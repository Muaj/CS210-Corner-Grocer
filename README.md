# CS210-Corner-Grocer
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
This program is built to read a text file of every grocery item purchased and report the amount of items in the list.
What did you do particularly well?
The program is small and computes quickly
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would prompt the user for the name of the text file in the future so they would be able to upload new lists. I would also try to use better logic so that the program
can handle much larger lists without taking a long time.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this code was to read an input text as I've never done so in a project before. As with most programming issues, StackOverload is where I found my solution.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
As reading input text was my biggest issue with this program it also is the skill I think would be a strong transferable skill to other projects.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to make this program as small and simple as possible to read. Looking back at it I would really of liked to make a prompt for the user to input a textfile they wanted read.
